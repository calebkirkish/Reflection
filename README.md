# Reflection
No code, just a README explaining my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer

## 1. What have I learned so far
I have learned that there is an incredible amount of information to this that we cannot even fathom from the beginning. I know that i have struggled so much with this program and that my team mates are years ahead of where I am at but I am very thankful that I have them as team mates and that they support me 100% and nothing comes easy.

## 2. What have I accomplished so far
I have accomplished a number of projects and I am continuing to learn more every day and i hope that once I complete this program I can finally branch off and learn even more than what I have already learned. React is so cool but it is a behemoth all on its own. NodeJS is very amazing and I hope to learn more about it in the future. 

## 3. Think back to the first week, how have I changed since then?
Man, the fact that I still remember doing some of the prework and feeling somewhat confident and doing the very first assignment made me feel like I over estimated my abilities and when we got into password generator and codeQuiz was absolutley nuts! And it just continued to get harder and harder but I kept pushing to find the answers, I kept trying to go to office hours and asking class mates for help. i am very lucky to have this entire group to help me and I am glad that we will continue to work together to meet our end goal of being professionally paid to do this kind of work!

# Path to Success
I know the course is already complete and that this is the last night to work on our homeworks and I am sort of just filling this out just to get the credit but I am also marking this as a new chapter to hopefully a better career and advancing even further than I am now into the big world of being a developer. I hope to continue doing projects on my own and building websites for friends and family and creating great big things that could potentially change everything. I have been talking to a lot of the people that I deliver wine to that are also developers and are very good at what they do and I hope that I can learn everything I can from them to really work in my groove and hone my skills and learn different languages to become versatile and experienced! This is only the beginning even when we have reached the end of the road for the bootcamp!
